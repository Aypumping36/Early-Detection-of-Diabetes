# Diabetes-Prediction
This project works on the analysis and creation of ML model for the diabetes data
# 🩺 Healthcare – Early Detection of Diabetes (ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

A mobile health clinic wants to pre-screen patients for diabetes using basic health indicators. The goal is to reduce hospital crowding and focus on high-risk individuals.

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and supervised machine learning classification models to:
- Identify key health indicators that influence diabetes risk.
- Predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on attributes like BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and age.
